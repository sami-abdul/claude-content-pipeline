# Client Assessment Guide

Evaluate client quality from the job posting text. No API access, so work with visible signals.

## Green Flags (Client)

- **Clear budget range** - Knows what they want to spend
- **Defined problem** - Can articulate the pain point clearly
- **Technical understanding** - Knows enough to have realistic expectations
- **Decision-maker** - Can approve scope and budget without committee
- **Verified payment history** - Previous successful hires/payments
- **Responsive** - Replies within 24-48 hours
- **Values expertise** - Hiring for skills, not cheapest option

## Green Flags (Project)

- **Aligned with expertise** - AI agents, trading bots, Web3, automation
- **Production intent** - Actually wants to deploy, not just prototype
- **Reasonable timeline** - At least 2-3 weeks for meaningful work
- **Budget matches scope** - $2K+ for starter, $10K+ for complex
- **Clear success criteria** - Knows what "done" looks like
- **Ongoing potential** - May lead to maintenance/expansion work

## Red Flags (Client)

| Flag | Why It's Bad | Response |
|------|--------------|----------|
| "Just a quick job" | Underestimates complexity | Clarify scope or pass |
| No budget mentioned | Fishing for lowest price | Ask for budget range upfront |
| Wants to pay after delivery | High risk of non-payment | Require 50% upfront minimum |
| Excessive NDAs upfront | May be hiding something | Standard NDA okay, custom legal = charge for review |
| "We'll pay more next time" | This time never comes | Quote full rate or pass |
| Asks for free sample/spec work | Devalues expertise | Offer paid discovery instead |
| Wants to move off-platform immediately | Avoiding platform protections | Stay on platform until contract signed |
| Poor communication | Will be nightmare during project | If slow before hiring, will be worse after |
| Unrealistic timeline | Recipe for failure | Quote rush rate (1.5x) or decline |
| "Clone of [competitor]" | Often unrealistic expectations | Deep discovery or pass |
| Compares to fiverr prices | Wrong expectations | Politely pass |

## Red Flags (Project)

| Flag | Why It's Bad | Response |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Vague requirements | Scope creep incoming | Require paid discovery phase |
| No existing codebase | Starting from scratch = more work | Price accordingly |
| Multiple stakeholders | Decision paralysis | Identify single decision-maker |
| "Easy" or "simple" | Never is | Ask detailed questions |
| Changing specs during proposal | Will change during project | Document everything |
| Budget < $1,500 | Not worth the overhead | Politely decline |
| "ASAP" without context | Poor planning on their part | Rush rate or pass |

## Deal Breakers (Always Pass)

1. Illegal or unethical projects (gambling non-legal, fraud, manipulation)
2. No budget discussion (client refuses to share any budget range)
3. Demands free work (spec work, unpaid trials, "exposure")
4. Disrespectful communication (rude, demanding, condescending)
5. Crypto scams (Ponzi schemes, pump-and-dump, fake tokens)
6. Copy/clone without value-add ("Build me Uber but for X")
7. Personal projects with business budgets expected (hobbyist wanting enterprise quality for hobby prices)

## Priority Scoring

| Priority | Criteria |
|----------|----------|
| **HIGH** | Clear scope + verified payment + budget > $5K + our niche |
| **MEDIUM** | Good client + decent budget + close to our niche |
| **LOW** | Unclear scope OR budget concerns OR outside expertise |
| **SKIP** | Red flags OR deal breakers OR < $1.5K budget |

## Soft Assessment (from posting text only)

When evaluating without API data, look for:

- **Posting specificity**: Detailed requirements = serious client. Vague one-liners = trouble.
- **Budget disclosure**: Stated budget (even a range) = good sign. "Budget: discuss" = cautious.
- **Tone**: Professional and clear = good. Demanding or condescending = warning.
- **Scope clarity**: Bullet-pointed requirements = organized client. Wall of text = may struggle to scope.
- **Tech mentions**: Correct terminology = technical client who gets it. Buzzword salad = possible mismatch.
- **Timeline stated**: Realistic timeline = planned project. No timeline = may expect "ASAP."
- **Hire rate / reviews visible**: High hire rate and good reviews = safe. New client with $0 spent = unknown (not a red flag, just unknown).
