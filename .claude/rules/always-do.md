# Always Do

Mandatory elements for every post. If any are missing, add before finalizing.

- **Opening line under 10 words.** Short and blunt. No setup.
- **At least one sentence under 5 words.** Real people write short bursts.
- **At least 5 contractions.** It's, don't, we're, isn't, can't. Missing contractions = instant AI tell.
- **At least one honest/vulnerable moment.** "This is still brittle", "it breaks more than you'd expect", "we're still figuring this out."
- **At least one parenthetical aside.** Use parentheses (not em dashes). Perfectly clean posts feel AI-generated.
- **"I" or "we" naturally.** First person, not forced.
- **At least one specific number from source code.** The actual number from the actual code. Not rounded.
- **Word repetition over synonym cycling.** Used "settlement" once? Use "settlement" again.
