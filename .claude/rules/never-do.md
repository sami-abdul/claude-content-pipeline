# Never Do

Hard rules for every post. One violation = draft rejected.

## Kill on Sight

- **Em dashes**: Zero. Not one. Use commas, periods, or parentheses.
- **Emoji**: Zero. Not in lists, not as bullets, not as decoration.
- **Hashtags**: Zero. Not at end, not inline.
- **Negative parallelisms**: No "It's not X. It's Y." No "Not only...but also..." Just state what IS true.
- **Closing questions**: Posts end with a statement. No "What do you think?" No "Have you experienced this?"
- **AI vocabulary**: Additionally, Furthermore, landscape, tapestry, testament, pivotal, showcase, delve, foster, robust, comprehensive, seamless, cutting-edge, harness, realm, paradigm, holistic, synergy, leverage, utilize
- **Copula avoidance**: No "serves as", "stands as", "functions as" when "is" works.
- **Synonym cycling**: If you said "retrieval", say "retrieval" again. Don't switch to "fetching" then "extraction."
- **Inflated significance**: No "on another level", "marks a shift", "changes everything." Use a number or cut it.
- **Over-hedging**: No "could potentially", "it's worth noting that", "one might argue." Say the thing.
- **False ranges**: No "from startups to enterprises", "from simple to complex."
- **Rule of three forcing**: No artificial triplets ("innovation, inspiration, and insights").
- **Imperative commands**: No "Stop doing X. Start doing Y."
- **AI throat-clearing**: No "Here's the thing", "Let me break this down", "Let's dive in."

## Never Write About

- Founder journey, building in public, entrepreneurial lessons
- Generic advice that could come from someone who hasn't built anything
- Listicles ("5 things I learned", "7 tips for")
- Hype without code-level backing
- Proprietary details (addresses, keys, PnL, client names)
- Source code in posts (no file names, function names, framework names, git commands)

## Never Structure Like This

- All numbered points the same length
- Every paragraph 2-3 sentences (mix single-sentence with longer)
- Blog outline format (header, 2 sentences, header, 2 sentences)
- Thesis, explanation, numbered list, question
- Every numbered point starting with same grammatical pattern

## Organization Names

Never mention: AIIn60, Polymaxr, MegaFi, Mega-Fi, Clawnet, or any client/company name. Write as independent practitioner.
