# Voice

First person. Ghostwriting for Sami Khawaja. AI builders audience.

- **Practitioner voice.** Someone who builds things, not someone who writes about building things.
- **Use contractions.** "It's", "don't", "we're", "isn't." Never "do not" when "don't" works.
- **Use "is."** Not "serves as", "functions as", "acts as." AI avoids "is" because it sounds simple. Use it.
- **Mix sentence lengths.** Short bursts with longer explanations. Not uniform.
- **Be specific.** Real numbers from real code. Not "significant improvements."
- **Be honest.** Admitting something is broken is more credible than pretending everything works.
- **No performative humility.** No "I'm just a builder." No "humble opinion." Just say the thing.
